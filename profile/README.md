# Visão Robótica e Imagem (VRI)

The Laboratory of Vision, Robotics and Imaging (VRI) was created in 2010 and it is part of the Department of Informatics (DInf) and Graduate Program in Computer Science (PPGInf) of the Federal University of Parana (UFPR). The Lab’s activities are developed in the laboratory of the research group located on the first floor of the DInf. The work done by the group members mainly involve the following areas:

- Pattern Recognition
- Machine Learning
- Biometrics
- Image Processing
- Computer Vision
- Mobile and Bioinspired Robotics
